# CRUD Operations with Axios and React

## Features

- **Create Page**: Allows users to add new user details.
- **Edit Page**: Enables users to modify existing user details.
- **Delete Functionality**: Users can delete user details directly from the home page.
- **Toast Notifications**: Displays success or error messages using toast notifications from the `react-toastify` library.
